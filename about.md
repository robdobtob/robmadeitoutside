If you've found this blog, welcome to what will hopefully be a mostly coherent representation of my thoughts. The goal is of this is to provide a way for me to more explicitly consolidate my ideas, opinions and experiences across all facets of what I do for me and for others to enjoy.

I aspire to keep things plain and simple, fighting a system's entropic progression towards complexity much like unending chaos that is a draw full of Tupperware containers. Sometimes this is successful and sometimes curiosity and optimism gets the better of me and I'm left with half completed projects with much higher aspirations than execution commitments. [^1]

[^1]: If you're reading this, hopefully that means I've managed to keep things simple enough!

I'm essentially the winning bingo card of a software developer.
- I enjoy bashing my head against build issues, developing tooling/frameworks and spending way too much time trying to automate something in my workflow that doesn't justify the effort.
- I live for exploring the great outdoors, nothing makes me feel more alive than scrambling up the side of a mountain extreme weather conditions or spending hours skinning up a hill for the 5 minutes of euphoria skiing back down afterwards. 
- I love to create. Sometimes software projects scratch this itch but usually Iâ€™ve got some form of project that involves physically tangible outcomes like wood working, knitting or sewing.
