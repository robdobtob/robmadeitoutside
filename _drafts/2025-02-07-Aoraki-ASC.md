The main agenda item for my 2025 New Zealand trip was a week long mountaineering training course near Aoraki which I did with [Alpine Guides](https://alpineguides.co.nz/alpine-skills-course).

It was an incredible week up in the mountains, with a great group of people. Big shout out to the team and guides.
Nature also did a pretty good job with sunrise and sunset bringing incredible colours on all sides, and we even had the full moon lighting the way.

The first question asked of us on the course was "Why are you doing this?".
Initially my answer was to head out on bigger and badder ski touring missions post my Japow trip, and while this is definititely still a possibility, it was scoped a little to small.
Now I can also go and bigger and badder hikes! I'm no crazy peak bagger, I hike on a whim, and now my hikes dont have to stop in winter, at the snow line, and definitely not when the trail stops!


# The Location
We spent the entire week of the course up on the Tasman Glacier in Kellman's Hut.
The location for the course was kept secret from the group until we arrived on the first morning.
People were pretty excited when we found out, but it didnt really mean anything to me until we made it up to the hut just how incredible this week was going to be.

Getting up to the hut was not clear cut to start with.
The weather report for pretty much the entire week was low clouds, wind and rain which isn't conducive to flying a helicopter up into the mountains.
In the end we had incredible luck with the weather and were able to get out onto the glacier every day of the course.
