  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    I'm a force multiplier, leveraging my time to guide technical roadmaps as well as mentor team members to promote their growth and realise their potential.
    While I initially focused on my individual contribution to software, my natural tendency to help people and optimise processes resulted in my role shifting quickly to prioritise these aspects which significantly increased my impact.
    My skill set enables me to execute on solving difficult and complex problems; starting out with initial research on the problem space, solution ideation, its implementation, the distribution process and then its subsequent iteration based on data driven decisions, enabled through effective monitoring.
    This impulse to help people has shifted my purpose in life to uplift those who are in poverty due to inequalities outside of their control.
    As someone who lives on this planet I also cannot stand by without applying my strengths to help fight climate change driven which I believe is driven by the same unsustainable actions and greed that promotes the worlds growing inequality.

        Global Finalist out of 30k participants at the NASA SpaceApps Hackathon for our solution to identify remote/temporary communities from satellite images.  This was achieved using a retrained MaskRCNN model for identification and utilizing the ELK stack for processed data storage and visualization.  A major focus of our project effort was identifying key areas of value that could be delivered within the short time frame, providing an initially targeted solution to a general problem allowing for a much wider scope once actual value was identified.
