  review: While there are so many different factors that influence the state of a nation, Prisoners of Geography is able to attribute a substantial number of these to their geography. This book has deepened my understanding on geopolitical influences, outlining implications across past, present and future.

  review: Surprisingly engaging after a bit of a slow start with some insightful remarks against religion, politics, war and purpose. There is a lot more to this world to explore and understand. Not quite the 'AI overlords' that I was expecting based on all the Elon references.

  review: So so good. I love how much weight is put on the mental health struggles that the protagonists (and antagonists) experience as they grow and develop as characters. This adds so much more to their journeys and the already incredibly built world and story arcs.

  review: An extremely whack book, but an interesting read due to beautiful way of expressing philosophical approaches to life. The naivety presented of Nakata provides a lovely insight into the purity of simplicity as well as the vast depth of understanding that can be achieved within it. I really liked how Murakami blended in a divine appreciation for art and music, initially subtle but gradually placing more and more emphasis on the vast world of introspection, connection and mutual understanding that can be made through it.

  review: I have been absolutely loving Ursula Le Guin. A beautiful series of books highlighting the importance of understanding the true nature of things as well as the value and depth of trust associated with expressing your true self to others. All throughout the series, the use of magic is weighed against an equilibrium and consideration of consequences. Its not some infinite power, merely a redirection and distribution of impact that ripples throughout the fabric of the planet. The Wizard of Earthsea explores the corruption of self due to ego and insecurities. The Tombs of Atuan highlights the power of control through information inequality and the power of forgiveness to oneself as the final hurdle to growth. The Farthest Shore attacks the nature of humanity, with greed and consumerism destroying the very foundations of the world and the magic that supports it. For a book written in the 70s, there are so many aspects of this critic on society that I see rampant today, driven by the tech industry and its corruption of individuals time.

  review: Really really enjoyed this book, quite aligned with my current echo chamber of excessive capitalism and consumerism is bad. Provides an interesting comparison between a society where people are ruled by explicit power and possession of wealth and a society where control is achieved via conformity of opinion and the collective betterment of the cohort. Overcoming both of requires the individuals to ensure that they are able to hold freedom of thought.

  review: Provided some interesting points into sustainability and the importance of human connection to one another and to all life on the planet. Ended up being highly political, and even though I agreed with these arguments and am on the same side, they were very accusatory rather than constructive. Not the content I was expecting.
