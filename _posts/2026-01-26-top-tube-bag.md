I've been meaning to explore making my own bike packing bags since stumbling across [Terra Rossa Gear](https://www.instagram.com/terra_rosa_gear/) and their frame bags made from off cuts.
The second death via hernia of my Exped Synmat over new years provided the perfect opportunity.
In the next few days I started to salvage the mat for some ultralight bike packing bag material and also splashed out on a new Nemo Tensor Extreme because, well, I was also waiting for a good excuse to do that as well.

And so, from the ashes of the Exped Synmat UL rises my brand new Exped Pheonix.

I started the salvage more as an autopsy to try figure out why the mat had failed as this is a well known failing of these mats.
Most reports online blamed it on a poor adhesive that didnt hold up under moisture but that wasn't the problem here.
Multiple of the baffles[^1] had torn along the entire length.
I'm it was actually the summer heat the killed the mat via a two pronged attack; the heat weakened the plastic as well as increased the pressure to rip things in two.

Designs for the bag came together pretty quickly as I am still holding my mates Apidura top tube bag hostage after my last bike packing trip around Wisemans Ferry.
One additional feature I've added is a dedicated phone pocjet on the inside of the bag for some order and easy access.
The bag dimensions were used to put together a simple template in CAD that never made it out from the 2D plane, printed it with and without a seam allowance and finally cut it out from some plastic sleeves.
The non-seam-allowanced cut outs were used to add some amount of rigidity to the walls as I didnt want the empty bag to flop around too much.
The seam-allowanced template was used to cut out all the panels due to its more complex shape. Even with the template this took a couple of attempts because I kept messing up the left-right inside-ouside panel pairings.

This isn't my first sewing project (some day I'll write up about the 3 year long project to refurish some chairs and sew some cushions) but I've never worked with this kind of technical fabric.
As such it was time to figure out what on earth thread tension is.
I grab a few of my failed cutting attempts and started to tweak how the machine was going to be setup for both a normal running stitch and some very short zig zag stiches which will be used to make the daisy chain for mounting.
Now with all the materials cut and a bit more confidence on how the sewing machine and I were going to handle sewing what is essentially a plastic sheet, it was time to make these 2D shapes a bag!

I started with the internal pocket as it was the least planned for and I only had one attempt if I was going to be able to keep the Exped logo.
I lined the pocket lip with a bit of elastic to help hold the pocket taught but I'm not exactly sure its doing anything because the material itself as absolutely zero stretch.

Next was the side panels, these are double layer for a couple of reasons:

- I borrowed a feature from the Apidura bag which is the use of a velcro divider to help keep things in the bag organised. The double layering let me hide the stitching for this on the inside panel.
- I slid a plastic sheet between the two layers to add rigidity to the bag. When sewing these, its important to remember that the front seam has to be sewn last so you can actually get the plastic sheet inside. Unfortunately these panels were a little large and so I ended up sewing through them a couple of times which I think added to the slight wonk that the bag has.
- I thought it was going to look sick to have orange highlight panels and and pocket against the rest of the grey bag.
- I'm also hopefully optimistic that it will increase the strength and durability of the bag.
  The drive side panel was finished by attaching the phone pocket.
  There was a lot of apprehension here when lining it up so that the pocket was actually large enough but once I flipped it over and got to see the completed panel I was super excited about how this bag was going to turn out.

At this point I was still watching lots of different YouTube videos on how to sew the zipper panel and put together the cute little zipper garages so I started on the webbing instead.
I'm a big fan of bright, offensive colours and combinations so was stoked when the purple webbing turned up and how it paired with my left over orange thread from the afore mentioned chair refurb project that also sort of matched the orange panels.
This part of the process was extremely tedious and time consuming.
The zigzag stitching got caught a couple of times as the stepper mechanism struggled to pull the small amount of thin fabric with the thick webbing.
Unstitching really dense zigzag thread is far from the most enjoyable aspect of sewing.
The other thing I was starting to realise at this point was that something didn't seem quite right with the length of webbing and the size of the bag.
At this point, I wasn't aware of what was coming and didnt have enough webbing to start again anyway so powered on bliss fully unaware.

I couldn't avoid the zipper section anymore, and was really making a bigger fuss of the whole thing than I expected.
One thing I did to hedge my bets was to make sure that the final width was going to be wider than the panel needed to be so that I could cut everything to the correct width afterwards.
Now that I'm reflecting on the build, I reckon I could have put together this panel in the same was as the chair cushions by simply doubling the desired panel width, folding it in half and running a top stitch along the zipper edge.
This would have also had the benefit of making it easier to double wall the panel as there were a couple of points were I missed the second layer.
Figuring out the zipper garages took a bit of patience and trying to keep everything flat while I sewed the two sides together was a bit hard, but luckily it being a zipper made it easy to align things.
After cutting the zipper to width, I sewed the webbing and zipper together to complete the boxing and added a strip of ribbon as binding to clean up the seams.

Now for the hard part!
It's now that I was finally realising how off my lengths were going to be, and I didnt really have enough of the clips to properly figure out how much this was going to bite me.
I line everything up at the front because I was most worried about the phone pocket and zipper and thought there was a bit more flexibility around where the webbing ended up.
I got half of the way through the first panel when I realised the panel was on back to front.
Time for a break.

> back to front

Take two, and now we get to figure out what to do with our mismatched lengths.
Again I sewed along the bottom half the way around before starting from the front and sewing along the top zipper side.
Where they met I then folded the excess from the bottom webbing panel back underneath itself which luckily was just enough to line the webbing and zipper up.
This ended up creating essentially a second zipper garage for the first garage to park into.
Feeling pretty confident with the outcome, I cracked straight in to the joining the second panel.
I swear I had everything lined up exactly the same, but the 2D to 3D mapping and stiff material made this really hard.
As I started round the top half it was pretty clear that things weren't quite lined up giving the bag a kink to the left but I'm not going to let that get me down.

The final reveal of flipping the whole bag inside out was super exciting and had me grinning from ear to ear. I ran straight out and mounted it on the bike with some velcro straps and a repurposed sea to summit strap.

The lesson I learnt from this project is to measure twice, cut twice, and still somehow have the dimensions all messed up.
I've also got to go back to school and practive my net geometry so I can do more 2D to 3D mapping.

All I need to do now is plan another overnight bikepacking trip to take this bad boy out for a spin!
