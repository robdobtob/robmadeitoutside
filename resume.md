# Summary
My extensive experience as a Software Engineer extends past pure development to include people, product and team management. This skill set has been developed during the growth of a small asset development and delivery team which has enabled scaled exposure to reinforce an understanding of business value and targeted feature development. I thoroughly enjoy the complexity of system integration with a desire to pursue this into the realm of robotics and control.

# Education

# Experience

### NDYLTK
November 2016 - April 2017
Rail Systems Engineer
- Initially started out as a 3 month summer internship at a rail consultancy engineering firm where I was offered a more permanent part time role during University.
- Involved in system modelling, simulation and analysis of client’s rail network to investigate validity of network upgrades based on current electrical infrastructure. This was achieved using proprietary software as well VBA macros developed for modelling automation and data analysis that required reverse engineering database structures.

# Skills Profile
## Tech Stack:
* 4+ years JavaScript/Typescript experience for FrontEnd and BackEnd services.
- 2+ years Java SpringBoot framework within a Dockerized microservice architecture.
- React Native (Android) developer utilizing Redux state management and enabling offline support.
- Use of the ELK stack, MongoDB and Splunk platforms for data storage and visualization.
## Certifications:
 - AWS Solutions Architect (2021)

# Key Achievements
## NASA SpaceApps Global Finalist 2019
Global Finalist for the NASA SpaceApps Hackathon, where over a period of 24hrs we developed a cloud platform to identify remote/temporary communities from satellite images This was achieved using a retrained MaskRCNN model for identification and utilizing the ELK stack for processed data storage and visualization A major focus of our project eﬀort was identifying key areas of value that could be delivered within the short time frame, providing an initially targeted solution to a general problem allowing for a much wider scope once actual value was identified.

## Honours Thesis 2018
My honours thesis, completed as part of a 6 month internship at Accenture, investigated the ability to improve robotic control systems through biomimicry. This attempted to improve upon existing Generative Adversarial Networks and Reinforcement Learning techniques to produce a control system for a quadruped. The control system was trained on a dataset was extracted from videos of animal motion through existing deep learning pose estimation. 
## Accenture Bootcamp Participant 2017
Generated a proof of concept and presented this to an Accenture client with a group of University students. Over the course of one week helped develop a database server backend and SPLUNK front end to meet the specifications of the client. The  backend was self populating through the use of Google Maps and image recognition API’s as well as HTML scripts to extract data from existing online databases.
## RTSA NSW Undergraduate Challenge Winner 2016
As part of a team of four undergraduate students, we produced and presented a proposal for the upgrade of an existing railway link. A tender report and sales presentation were submitted over a three week period. Our innovative ideas and resourceful approach, along with our proposal delivery were key to our success. The competition provided an extensive insight into the tender proposal process, project development, budget considerations and the interlinking of design components as well as the process of taking an innovative idea and producing a real world product.

## AIRUS Team Member 2015-2016
An extra-curricular University project in conjunction with Texas A&M University to develop the ability for international control of a UAV FPV quadcopter. As a member I worked on the design and construction of the UAV as well as its control methods and fail safes. This has provided an insight into the product development process, budget management, working with industry and planning of international projects.
