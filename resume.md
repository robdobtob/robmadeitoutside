# Summary
Initially my career had a focus as an Software Engineering individual contributor. Very quickly however, the people management and process optimisation became a much larger aspect of my role and has provided significantly more value to me than implementation details.
As a result, I strive to spend my time mentoring team members to promote their growth and realise their potential.
These positive externalities also apply to the work I enjoy doing, applying myself to improve the well-being the worlds disadvantaged population and environmental impact.
My skill set enables me to execute on solving difficult and complex problems, starting out with initial research on the problem space, solution ideation and then its subsequent implementation, distribution process and the iteration of these enabled through monitoring of appropriate metrics.

## Constantinople
July 2023 - December 2024

Senior Staff Engineer

- Enabled the successful delivery and continued management of 4 client environments by developing our banking platform configuration service to support runtime configuration as well as build and infrastructure configuration requirements. This required significant research into our security and data isolation strategies that was presented to internal, client and regulatory stakeholders. Integrated continuous delivery practices as part of this for one client to promote development culture via a successful initiative client.
- Drove a shift in product release frequency from quarterly to fortnightly while reducing the occurrence of release blockers. This was achieved by pioneering a cultural shift through the delineation of software delivery and feature delivery in order to reduce defect leakage and increase change velocity. I developed and rolled out a feature flag system to enable the decoupling between these two facets of delivery. 
- Enhanced the backend testing process by developing data injection tooling that supported unit, integration and end-to-end test functionality. Trend/outcome of bugs, was then leveraged for the development of user acceptance testing to automate regression testing with greater confidence.
- Heavily involved in security audit processes, managing and executing the remediation of findings as well as handling client success for critical security flows including customer sign-up, login and account recovery through discussion with their Chief Information Security Officer.
- Heavily involved in the technical aspects of the interview process, conducting interviews and iterating on the structure and questions. Lead to the hiring of 8 engineers that stayed with the company for more than 1 year.

February 2023 - July 2023

# Key Achievements

## Pollinate Volunteer

2020 - Current

Engaged with the [Pollinate Group](https://pollinategroup.org/) to develop a new customer sales management interface for marginalised women they empower as entrepreneurs.
The solution was to build a dedicated mobile phone application catered for low literacy and low tech literacy users by leveraging clear imagery, large interactive components as well as provide text-to-voice across multiple languages for all components.
Directly engaged with stakeholders to gather application requirements, iterate on designs, enable roll-out to users and presented usage analytics to the leadership team.
  - To improve the application adoption we travelled to India to;
    - Work in person training the outreach/distribution teams so that they could effectively support the entrepreneurs.
    - Communicate directly with the entrepreneurs to gather user feedback as well as observe how they interact with the app to better understand behaviours.
    - Train Pollinate's technical team on support processes to promote self-sustainability as well as improve end user support experience.

## NASA SpaceApps Global Finalist 2019

Global Finalist for the NASA SpaceApps Hackathon, where over a period of 24hrs we developed a cloud platform to identify remote/temporary communities from satellite images.
This was achieved using a retrained MaskRCNN model for identification and utilizing the ELK stack for processed data storage and visualization.
A major focus of our project effort was identifying key areas of value that could be delivered within the short time frame, providing an initially targeted solution to a general problem allowing for a much wider scope once actual value was identified.

## Honours Thesis 2018

My honours thesis, completed as part of a 6 month internship at Accenture, investigated the ability to improve robotic control systems through bio-mimicry.
This attempted to improve upon existing Generative Adversarial Networks and Reinforcement Learning techniques to produce a control system for a quadruped.
The control system was trained on a dataset was extracted from videos of animal motion through existing deep learning pose estimation.


## Accenture Bootcamp Participant 2017

Generated a proof of concept and presented this to an Accenture client with a group of University students.
Over the course of one week helped develop a database server backend and SPLUNK front end to meet the specifications of the client.
The  backend was self populating through the use of Google Maps and image recognition API’s as well as HTML scripts to extract data from existing online databases.

## RTSA NSW Undergraduate Challenge Winner 2016
As part of a team of four undergraduate students, we produced and presented a proposal for the upgrade of an existing railway link.
A tender report and sales presentation were submitted over a three week period.
Our innovative ideas and resourceful approach, along with our proposal delivery were key to our success.
The competition provided an extensive insight into the tender proposal process, project development, budget considerations and the interlinking of design components as well as the process of taking an innovative idea and producing a real world product.
