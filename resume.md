# Summary
My extensive experience as a Software Engineer extends past pure development to include people, product and team management.
This skill set has been developed during the growth of a small asset development and delivery team which has enabled scaled exposure to reinforce an understanding of business value and targeted feature development.
I thoroughly enjoy the complexity of system integration with a desire to pursue this into the realm of robotics and control.

# Experience

## Constantinople
February 2023 - December 2024
Staff Engineer
- Enabled the successful delivery and continued management of 4 client environments by developing our banking platform configuration service to support runtime configuration as well as build and infrastructure configuration requirements. This required significant research into our security and data isolation strategies that was presented to internal, client and regulatory stakeholders. Integrated continuous delivery practices as part of this for one client to promote development culture via a successful initiative client.
- Drove a shift in product release frequency from quarterly to fortnightly while reducing the occurence of release blockers. This was achieved by pioneering a cultural shift through the delineation of software delivery and feature delivery in order to reduce defect leakage and increase change velocity. I developed and rolled out a feature flag system to enable the decoupling between these two facets of delivery. 
- Enhanced the backend testing process by developing data injection tooling that supported unit, integration and e2e test functionality. trend/outcome of bugs, was then leveraged for the development of user acceptance testing to automate regression testing with greater confidence.
- Heavily involved in security audit processes, managing and executing the remediation of findings as well as handling client success for critical security flows including customer sign-up, login and account recovery through discussion with their CISO.
- Delivered a serverless backend for the customer onboarding pipeline, meeting APRA and AUSTRAC compliance requirements, leading to the acquisition of 1000+ small business bank customers onto the platform. Iterated on the solution to increase the percentage of supported businesses by 13% as well as reduce manual effort involved in onboarding reviews () and ongoing due diligence processes ().
- Heavily involved in the technical aspects of the interview process, conducting interviews and iterating on the structure and questions. Lead to the hiring of 8 engineers that stayed with the company for more than 1 year.

## Accenture
August 2018 - September 2022
Advanced App Engineering Manager
- Lead backend development of a enterprise automation delivery platform redesign which has been deployed at 100+ clients. Focussed on addressing issues with end user complexity of the product in order to improve the scalability of the product delivery.
- Actively involved in improving CICD and overall development processes for the product to address issues with scaled application delivery. This enabled shifting release cadence from quarterly to monthly.
- Pioneered a transition to an agile delivery process, where I took up a Product Owner/Scrum Master role within a team of 10 to deliver value based on gathered client requirements.
- Scoped, developed and lead an automation monitoring platform to provide direct feedback to clients on the return of investment from our asset suite.
- Involved in client engagement and delivery of the same automation delivery platform to both internal and external client teams. The product has a major focus on User-Hybrid Automation to incorporate manual tasks and approval within infrastructure and application areas of business operations.

## NDYLTK
November 2016 - April 2017
Rail Systems Engineer
- Initially started out as a 3 month summer internship at a rail consultancy engineering firm where I was offered a more permanent part time role during University.
- Involved in system modelling, simulation and analysis of client’s rail network to investigate validity of network upgrades based on current electrical infrastructure. This was achieved using proprietary software as well VBA macros developed for modelling automation and data analysis that required reverse engineering database structures.

# Skills Profile

# Key Achievements

## Pollinate Volunteer
2020 - Current
Engaged with the [Pollinate Group](https://pollinategroup.org/) to develop a new customer sales management interface for marginalised women they empower as entrepreneurs. The solution was to build a dedicated mobile phone application catered for low literacy and low tech literacy users by leveraging clear imagery, large interactive components as well as provide text-to-voice across multiple languages for all components. Directly engaged with stakeholders to gather application requirements, iterate on designs, enable rollout to users and presented usage analytics to the leadership team.
  - To improve the application adoption we travelled to India to;
    - Work in person training the outreach/distribution teams so that they could effectively support the entrepreneurs.
    - Communicate directly with the entrepreneurs to gather user feedback as well as observe how they interact with the app to better understand behaviours.
    - Train Pollinate's technical team on support processes to promote self-sustainability as well as improve end user support experience.

## NASA SpaceApps Global Finalist 2019
Global Finalist for the NASA SpaceApps Hackathon, where over a period of 24hrs we developed a cloud platform to identify remote/temporary communities from satellite images This was achieved using a retrained MaskRCNN model for identification and utilizing the ELK stack for processed data storage and visualization A major focus of our project eﬀort was identifying key areas of value that could be delivered within the short time frame, providing an initially targeted solution to a general problem allowing for a much wider scope once actual value was identified. You can find more details on our [submmission page here](https://2019.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/living-our-world/curious-minds-come-helping-hands/teams/planet-captain/project).

## Honours Thesis 2018
My honours thesis, completed as part of a 6 month internship at Accenture, investigated the ability to improve robotic control systems through biomimicry. This attempted to improve upon existing Generative Adversarial Networks and Reinforcement Learning techniques to produce a control system for a quadruped. The control system was trained on a dataset was extracted from videos of animal motion through existing deep learning pose estimation. 

## Accenture Bootcamp Participant 2017
Generated a proof of concept and presented this to an Accenture client with a group of University students. Over the course of one week helped develop a database server backend and SPLUNK front end to meet the specifications of the client. The  backend was self populating through the use of Google Maps and image recognition API’s as well as HTML scripts to extract data from existing online databases.

## RTSA NSW Undergraduate Challenge Winner 2016
As part of a team of four undergraduate students, we produced and presented a proposal for the upgrade of an existing railway link. A tender report and sales presentation were submitted over a three week period. Our innovative ideas and resourceful approach, along with our proposal delivery were key to our success. The competition provided an extensive insight into the tender proposal process, project development, budget considerations and the interlinking of design components as well as the process of taking an innovative idea and producing a real world product.

## AIRUS Team Member 2015-2016
An extra-curricular University project in conjunction with Texas A&M University to develop the ability for international control of a UAV FPV quadcopter. As a member I worked on the design and construction of the UAV as well as its control methods and fail safes. This has provided an insight into the product development process, budget management, working with industry and planning of international projects.
